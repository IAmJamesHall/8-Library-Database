# Team Treehouse Project 8
## SQL & Express

This project started with a database of books. Based off of a design mockup, I built the user interface and backend to modify and read the database. This project implements all CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations.

My starter files were `library.db`, `style.css`, and the mockups.

I added my own `custom.css` file to work with some of my extra credit features.
 
### Features
 - Database CRUD operations
  - Displaying books from database in table
  - Adding new books to database
  - Modifying data for individual books
  - Deleting individual books
- 404 error handling
 
### Extra credit
 - Search bar
 - Sort books by any column (ascending or descending)
 - pagination for books
